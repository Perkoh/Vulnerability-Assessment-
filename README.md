# Vulnerability Assessment

## Objective

This project focuses on performing a comprehensive network vulnerability assessment using two powerful tools: Nmap for network discovery and Nessus for vulnerability scanning. The aim is to identify potential security vulnerabilities within a network, assess their impact, and provide recommendations for mitigation.

### Skills Learned

- Learned how to use Nmap to scan networks, discover live hosts, enumerate open ports, and identify running services.
- Developed the ability to map out network structures and understand the communication patterns between devices.
- Gained experience in configuring and running Nessus scans to identify vulnerabilities in network devices, servers, and applications.
- Learned how to interpret Nessus scan results, understanding different types of vulnerabilities, their severity, and potential impact.
- Learned how to assess and prioritize vulnerabilities based on their severity and the potential risk they pose to the network.
- Gained a deeper understanding of network security principles, including common vulnerabilities, security misconfigurations, and methods for mitigating risks.
- Developed the ability to troubleshoot network issues that might arise during scanning, such as firewalls blocking scans or network devices behaving unexpectedly.

### Tools Used

- Nessus
- Nmap
